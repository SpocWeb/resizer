This project should run as is. To see PdfiumRenderer in action, start the web
project and navigate to the following URL:

    http://localhost:5772/Test.pdf?width=100

(The port is incorporated in the project configuration so should just work. If
the web page opened on Run has a different port, update the port above accordingly.)

The PDF rendered is the PDF that is part of this project. A list of parameters
that can be provided can be found in Contrib\PdfiumRenderer\PdfiumRenderer\PdfiumRendererPlugin.cs.
